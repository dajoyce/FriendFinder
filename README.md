# FriendFinder

##General Overview:
In this homework assignment we had to build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from the users' responses to the survey questions and then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. Express was used to handle the routing. Since this is just for fun and I had to prepopulate the database a little bit, I did so with a DC Characters (Don't worry Catwoman and Harley Quinn probably wouldn't date you anyways).

##Getting Started:

1. Navigate to BLANKINSERTADDRESS HERE LATER
2. Follow the link to the survery page.
3. Fill in the about you section.
4. Take the survery and hit the submit button at the buttom.
5. Your "best match" should appear upon hitting the submit button.
